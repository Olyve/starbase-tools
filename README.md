# Starbase Tools

Starbase Tools is a Rust crate that is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io) to be included in other projects. This crate contains calculations that are useful for ship builders when building or upgrading a ship. An example is the generator coolant calculation, which takes some information about your ship and then gives a recommendation on how many radiators should be used. Another tool example is the ship speed calculator which can be used to get a rough estimate of how fast your ship is based on it's weight and thrust.

## Credits

This tool would not have been possible without the [Starbase](https://www.starbasegame.com/) community, including the FrozenByte team. I also want to give credit to the creator of [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c9UkQGZJRCfddoVx_XmbYCdaTjFUC_e1d2n47WcTLRE/edit#gid=632687776) for creating it and inspiring me to create a collection of tools. If anyone knows the name (in game is fine too), please let me know so that I can properly give them attribution!
